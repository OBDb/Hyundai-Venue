    description: "The Hyundai Venue is a subcompact crossover SUV positioned as the brand's entry-level SUV offering, below the Kona in size and price. Featuring a boxy, upright design with split headlights and Hyundai's signature cascading grille, it emphasizes practicality and urban-friendly dimensions while maintaining SUV styling cues. Built on a platform shared with the Accent sedan but with increased ride height, it's offered exclusively with front-wheel drive, positioning it as an urban crossover rather than a true off-road capable SUV. Powertrain options vary by market but typically center around a 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing approximately 121 HP in North America, paired with either a six-speed manual transmission (discontinued after 2020 in some markets) or a continuously variable transmission. The interior maximizes space efficiency with a straightforward, practical design featuring a standard 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility in most markets. Despite its entry-level positioning, the Venue offers Hyundai's SmartSense safety features including forward collision avoidance, lane keeping assist, and driver attention warning. A modest refresh in 2023 updated the styling with a wider grille and revised lighting elements. The Venue represents Hyundai's response to the growing demand for affordable small crossovers, effectively replacing traditional subcompact hatchbacks in many markets as consumer preferences shift toward SUV-style vehicles. By offering the styling and higher seating position of an SUV at a price point comparable to compact cars, the Venue has successfully attracted first-time buyers and those seeking an urban-friendly vehicle with a more commanding presence than a conventional small car."
